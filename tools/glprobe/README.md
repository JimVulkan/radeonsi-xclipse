# glprobe

A small test program for the built libraries, run from `adb shell`. It loads `libEGL_mesa.so` by
path (not the system EGL), creates a surfaceless desktop OpenGL context, renders each test into an
offscreen framebuffer and checks every pixel against values computed on the CPU. Nothing is shown
on screen.

| Test | Checks |
|---|---|
| 0 | context creation and the GL strings (no rendering) |
| 1 | clear |
| 2 | one triangle covering half the target |
| 3 | interpolated vertex attributes |
| 4 | `texelFetch`, `texture` and `textureGrad` on a 64x64 texture |
| 5 | alpha blending |
| 6 | depth test with two overlapping quads |
| 7 | uniform buffer |
| 8 | compute shader with 2D workgroups (`gl_GlobalInvocationID`) |
| 9 | occlusion query |
| 10 | 4x MSAA with a resolve blit |
| 11 | Minecraft's terrain sampling (`sampleNearest` through `textureGrad`) |
| 12 | ASTC 4x4 textures, UNORM and sRGB |
| 13 | ETC2 RGB8 textures |
| 14 | 3D ASTC texture, second slice sampled |
| 15 | discarded pixels don't write depth (cutout grass in front of water) |

## Building

With the Android NDK, from the repository root:

```sh
$NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android34-clang -O2 \
   -Iinclude tools/glprobe/glprobe.c -o glprobe -ldl -lm
```

## Running

Push the three libraries from the package and `glprobe` to the phone, then:

```sh
adb shell mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/rsi
adb push libEGL_mesa.so libgallium_dri.so glprobe /data/local/tmp/rsi/
adb shell "cd /data/local/tmp/rsi && chmod 755 glprobe && \
   MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=radeonsi LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/local/tmp/rsi \
   ./glprobe /data/local/tmp/rsi/libEGL_mesa.so 1-15"
```

The second argument selects tests as a comma-separated list or ranges; the default is `0`. The last
line is `=== n/m tests passed ===`, and the exit code is non-zero if any test failed.
